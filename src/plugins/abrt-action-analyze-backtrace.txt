abrt-action-analyze-backtrace(1)
================================

NAME
----
abrt-action-analyze-backtrace - Analyzes C/C++ backtrace, generates
duplication hash, backtrace rating, and identifies crash function
in dump directory DIR.


SYNOPSIS
--------
'abrt-action-analyze-backtrace' [-v] [-d DIR]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
The tool reads a file named 'backtrace' from problem dump directory,
generates duplication hash, backtrace rating, and identifies
crash function. Then it saves this data as new elements 'global_uuid',
'rating', 'crash_function' in this dump directory.

Integration with ABRT events
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
'abrt-action-analyze-backtrace' can be used as a secondary analyzer,
after backtrace has been generated. The data generated by
'abrt-action-analyze-backtrace' is useful for reporting the crash
to bug databases: rating makes it possible to prevent reporting of bugs
with low quality (non-informative) backtraces, duplication hash
is used to find already filed bugs about similar crashes.

Example usage in abrt_event.conf:

------------
EVENT=analyze analyzer=CCpp
        abrt-action-generate-backtrace || exit $?
        abrt-action-analyze-backtrace
------------

OPTIONS
-------
-d DIR::
   Path to dump directory.

-v::
   Be more verbose. Can be given multiple times.
