====================

NAME
----
abrt-action-mailx - Sends contents of a dump directory via email.

SYNOPSIS
--------
'abrt-action-mailx' [-v] -d DIR [-c CONFFILE]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
The tool reads a problem dump directory, composes an email message
from the directory contents, and uses mailx to send the message to
specified recipient.

Properties of email messages can be specified in a configuration file,
and via environment variables.

Configuration file
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Configuration file contains entries in a format "Option = Value".

The options are:

'Subject'::
       The subject of the email message.

'EmailFrom'::
       The sender of the email message.

'EmailTo'::
       The recipient of the email message.

'SendBinaryData'::
       Use yes/true/on/1 to attach all binary files from the dump
       directory to the email. This can cause the emails to be very
       large.

Integration with ABRT events
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
'abrt-action-mailx' can be used as a reporter, to allow users report
problems via email when they decide to do it. This usage is
pre-configured in /etc/abrt/events.d/mailx_events.conf:

------------
EVENT=report_Mailx      abrt-action-mailx
------------

It can also be used to notify administrator automatically when a
problem happens. When this is desired, modify the event configuration
file to run the tool on the 'post-create' event:

------------
EVENT=post-create	abrt-action-mailx
------------

   Path to dump directory.

-c CONFFILE::
   Path to configration file. When used in ABRT event system, the file
   contains site-wide configuration. Users can change the values via
   environment variables.

the configuration file.

       Subject of the email message.

'Mailx_EmailFrom'::
       Sender of the email message.
