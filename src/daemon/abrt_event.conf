# This configuration file specifies which programs should be run
# when the specified event occurs in crash dump lifetime.
#
# Example:
# EVENT=post-create   { pwd; date; }>/tmp/dt; echo $HOSTNAME `uname -r`
#
# Rule starts with a line with non-space leading character.
# All subsequent lines which start with space or tab form one rule.
# Note that separating newline is *retained*. Example:
# EVENT=post-create   date >/tmp/dt  # semicolon is not needed here!
#                     echo $HOSTNAME `uname -r`
#
# Rules may be commented out with #. One # is sufficient to comment out
# even a multi-line rule (no need to comment out every line).
#
# Rule of the form "include GLOB_PATTERN" recurses to each file which matches
# GLOB_PATTERN. Example: "include post-create.d/*.conf"
#
# Any other rules specify which programs to run on the crash dump.
#
# Each rule may have conditions to be checked before the program is run.
#
# Conditions have form VAR=VAL, where VAR is either word "EVENT"
# or a name of crash dump element to be checked (for example,
# "executable", "package", hostname" etc).
#
# If all conditions match, the remaining part of the rule
# (the "program" part) is run in the shell.
# All shell language constructs are valid.
# All stdout and stderr output is captured and passed to abrt
# and possibly to abrt's frontends and shown to the user.
#
# If the program terminates with nonzero exit code,
# the event processing is considered unsuccessful and is stopped.
# Last captured output line, if any, is considered to be
# the error message indicating the reason of the failure,
# and may be used by abrt as such.
#
# If the program terminates successfully, next rule is read
# and processed. This process is repeated until the end of this file.

# Example: if you want all users (not just root) to be able to see some problems:
#EVENT=post-create                      rm uid; chmod a+rX .

# uid file is missing for problems visible to all users
# (oops scanner is often set up to not create it).
# In this case, do not record username too:
EVENT=post-create                       if [ -f uid ]; then getent passwd "`cat uid`" | cut -d: -f1 >username; fi
